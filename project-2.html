        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Today there is huge Advancement in the Technical field which is increasing day by day.
            In early days there were only computer systems where we were able to perform only few tasks,
            but today new technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and
            few some others have made computer systems so advance that we can perform any type of task
            with them. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) have done remarkable progress and its
            Capability is increasing day by day. One of the application Area of AI is Natural Language
            Processing (NLP). Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps Humans to communicate with
            the computer system in their own Language. For example, Voice Assistant. Various voice
            assistants were developed and they are still being improved more for better performance to
            overcome struggling of humans to interact with their machine. we are trying to develop a voice
            assistant using python which will help user to perform any type of task without interaction with
            keyboard. The aim of this paper is to study how voice assistants behaves smartly and can be
            used to get everyday work done and also be used for educational purpose also</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Voice Command Integration</li>
            <li>Task Automation</li>
            <li>Multitasking Capabilities</li>
            <li>Attendence Marking by voice recognizing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <ol style="text-align: justify;">
            <li><b>Accurate Voice Recognition:</b> Ensuring the voice assistant accurately understands diverse accents, dialects, and pronunciations can be challenging, especially in noisy environments.</li>
            <li><b>Multitasking and Context Switching:</b> Handling multiple commands or switching between different tasks seamlessly can be difficult, particularly when managing conflicting or overlapping instructions.</li>
            <li><b>Personalization and Adaptation:</b> Creating an adaptive system that learns user preferences over time while maintaining accuracy and relevance in its responses presents a significant challenge.</li>
            <li><b>Natural Language Understanding (NLU):</b> Interpreting varied sentence structures and meanings correctly requires sophisticated NLP models, which can struggle with complex or ambiguous user queries.</li>
        </ol>
